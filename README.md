# SQL-Data-Cleaning-Analysis

This project involved cleaning a global company layoffs dataset using SQL to ensure data integrity allowing for an accurate exploratory analysis.

Key steps in cleaning included removing duplicates, standardizing industry labels, fixing data formatting issues, updating country and date fields, handling null values, and using joins to correct missing data.

The analysis part covered layoffs by company, industry, and country from 2020 to 2023, including post-IPO trends. Key techniques included ranking companies by layoffs, calculating monthly rolling totals, and using CTEs for complex queries.
